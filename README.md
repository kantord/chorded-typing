# chorded-typing

TODO:

  - figure out why the word "weak" cannot be typed
  - whats' wrong with 'pick'


Things to keep in mind about chords:

- it's inconvenient to type on the same hand with a combination of more than home row + 1 row. (So row 1 and 3 together should never happen on the same hand)
- typing more than 1 character on the same finger is very
- anything form the TGB or YHN column is very difficult if there's anything else on the same hand
- anything on home row is better
- basically 3-4 characters in a chord is ok, 5 is doable, anything more than that is a bit difficult probably ok on home row 
  - p z and q are more difficult letters
