Pyanist is a tool that allows chorded typing using a regular N-key rollover keyboard.
It allows you to use chorded typing in addition to normal typing, which means that you can
get started by chording a few frequent words instead of having to learn a whole system 
from scratch.

## Installing Pyanist

installed on your computer. If you have `pip` installed simply run:

```bash

```

**OS X/Windows**

pip install pyanist
```

After that you should be ready to run Pyanist.

**Note**: Pyanist has only been tested on _Linux_, albeit it should run also on OS X and Windows.
